This is the final project Calculator of Foundations of The Odin Project.

The goal of the project is to build a webpage calculator with 4 basic operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

The calculator displays the equation entered by the user on the top row; calculates the equation with a JavaScript function once the user presses "=" button; and displays the calculation result on the bottom row.

The calculator also includes two functional buttons: "DEL" for deleting lastly entered symbol; "AC" for clearing displays to allow next input.
